    <p> The brower cache stores information and data relevant to the current user session and is also relevant to future uses. Additionally, it stores local copies of the website for faster and convenient access by the browser. It is also a spot to store downloads, which are old versions of the forms. The reason why it resets the MailChimp form is because the process of clearing your cache essentially prevents you from using old forms. </p>
